### How can I help?

Ceres Logic is a one-person independent software contracting/consulting firm. Like many consultants, I refer to &#8220;Ceres Logic&#8221; as &#8220;we&#8221; on this site, even though it&#8217;s usually just me, Mike Desjardins. I (err, I mean, &#8220;we&#8221;) reside in Portland, Maine, USA.

### Mobile

Use of Mobile Applications is exploding. According to <a href="http://www.yankeegroup.com/pressReleaseDetail.do?actionType=getDetailPressRelease&ID=2468" target="_blank">Yankee Group</a>, Mobile Applications will account for $4.2 Billion in revenue by 2013. <a href="http://blog.nielsen.com/nielsenwire/online_mobile/android-most-popular-operating-system-in-u-s-among-recent-smartphone-buyers/" target="_blank">Neilsen</a>&#8216;s usage statistics show that the Android platform is the most popular among recent smartphone purchasers. Put Ceres Logic&#8217;s expertise with the Android platform to work for you. Check out Tidecast and Skicast, our two Android apps in the Android Marketplace.

### Web

I have extensive experience in building custom web applications using [Ruby on Rails][1] as well as large-scale enterprise open-source [Java][2] systems. I&#8217;ve worked on medium and large-scale e-commerce sites based on both Rails and Java. I&#8217;m also pretty handy at smaller jobs, like customizing [WordPress][3] installations to get small businesses an online presence.
