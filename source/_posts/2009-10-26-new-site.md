My old, temporary Ceres Logic website is gone, and I&#8217;ve replaced it with this new WordPress-based site.  I&#8217;ve also pulled over any blog posts from my personal blog that were more technically minded.  I&#8217;ve gone with a very minimalistic look for this new site, which is very intentional.  It&#8217;s also a bit more difficult than I expected &#8211; resisting the urge to pile in tons of widgets, sidebars, and elaborate colors takes some work.  It also takes some work to make the site look like I&#8217;ve done all this on purpose, and the plain look isn&#8217;t due to a lack of incentive.

Anyway, hope you like the new digs!
