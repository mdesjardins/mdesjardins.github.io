It downloads tidal information from NOAA, and calculates the moon phase and sunrise and sunset times. Â Tidecast can determine the closes tidal station to your current location using the GPS feature of your phone.

One of Tidecast&#8217;s nicest features is its homescreen widget, which displays the current tidal forecast for either the closest tide station, or the station of your choosing.
