    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve had a interest/passions/fascination with web accessibility (a11y) ever since I worked at my previous employer, <a href="https://www.sigient.com">Sigient</a> (note: they might be out of business now, and that site appears to be down). That particular job was a consulting company, and I ended up on the staff augmentation side of the business, which wasn&rsquo;t particularly awesome, but I&rsquo;ll save that story for another time.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I was working with one of the major nationwide internet service providers in the United States. They too are no longer in business, as they&rsquo;ve been recently acquired. One of the things I took on was converting some major swaths of their customer portal (an old Backbone web application) to instead use React. While I was in the middle of that task, the company had come under pressure to quickly make their customer portal accessible to users with disabilities. I have no idea where this pressure was coming from &ndash; there were rumors of a lawsuit, but this was hearsay and I have no idea if there was any truth to that.</p>

<p>I had very little exposure to web accessibility at that point in my career. In retrospect, it&rsquo;s shameful that this is the case, but I don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s uncommon. I&rsquo;ve been developing websites for well over 15 years, and never had I encountered a situation where anyone made accessibility a priority. Because of that, I knew next to nothing about roles or aria attributes, <a href="http://colorsafe.co/">web-accessible color palettes</a>, or the imporatance of using semantic elements and design to ensure that screen readers would be able to interpret pages that I&rsquo;ve been responsible for.</p>

<p>Since my experience at Sigient, I&rsquo;ve made a conscious effort to apply accessibility to my designs whenever I&rsquo;ve been afforded the opportunity. As I&rsquo;ve transitioned to doing a lot more front-end work, particularly in <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>, it&rsquo;s become clear that we have an opportunity to reduce the difficulty in building accessible rich internet applicaitons. Because React (and many of the other new Javascript frameworks) are component-based, component builders can focus on making their individual components accessible, while application developers can use off-the-shelf components which have been tested and meet minimum a11y guidelines.</p>

<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/React-icon.svg/1200px-React-icon.svg.png" alt="React Logo" /></p>

<p>This obviously requires buy-in from component developers, but I&rsquo;m optimistic that component based UI architecture will make this possible and achievable.</p>

<h2>react-a11y-select</h2>

<p>To that end, I&rsquo;ve started a project on npm to build a web-accessible select component. The first rule of accessibility is to use native components whenever possible. However, over the course of my career I&rsquo;ve seen many designs requiring select/dropdown components with styled options containing graphics and other elements. With this project I&rsquo;m hoping to make doing so in an accessible way super-simple.</p>

<p>I just started this project recently, and it doesn&rsquo;t even meet all the accessibility guidelines yet. It&rsquo;s not as performant as I&rsquo;d like. It&rsquo;s missing some key features that I want to add. But it&rsquo;s a start and it&rsquo;s my very first npm project, and first component library. I hope to keep plugging away at it, and introduce more components as I get better at this (I&rsquo;m thinking I might do Radio buttons next!).</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a link to the project on <a href="https://github.com/mdesjardins/react-a11y-select">Github</a> and on <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-a11y-select">npm</a>.</p>
