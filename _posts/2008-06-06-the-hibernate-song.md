(to the tune of <span style="font-style: italic;">The Spiderman Theme Song</span> from the original cartoon series)

Hibernate, Hibernate  
O/R Mapping sure is great  
Gavin King, and H-Q-L  
Make my life a living hell  
Look out! Here comes Hibernate!

Mapping Files in Hibernate  
Wish my team would annotate  
Are its queries optimized?  
Who knows &#8211; it&#8217;s always a surprise  
Hey there, there goes Hibernate!

Don&#8217;t fetch data now  
Lazy load, &#8216;cuz you might guess  
I don&#8217;t need it now  
Hibernate, you do know best!

Hibernate, Hibernate  
Friendly neighborhood Hibernate  
Grab the jars, and climb aboard  
OO models are your reward  
To it&#8230;  
Relational DBs are old-school  
When you need a complex tool  
You need the Hibernate!
