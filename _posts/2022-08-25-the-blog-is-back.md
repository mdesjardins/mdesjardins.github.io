I managed to dig up the old blog. It's a little bit sad how old these old posts all are. At one point, I thought I wanted to be a programmer's programmer. I wanted to write a book. Something like "Hibernate in Action." I followed my former colleague, [Chris Brogan](https://chrisbrogan.com/), an emerging social media superstar of the RSS-fueled blogosphere. I created posts with lots of images and encouraged engagement in the comments.

But that's not what this is about anymore.

I like to write. For me. I just enjoy it. And every time I had inspiration, I thought about blogging about it. But the problem was that my blog was in [Octopress](octopress.org). The premise of Octopress was great, it simplified pushing posts to your github pages site! And you could even write your posts in good ol' Markdown. It'd generate a static site for you!

But I let a lot of time pass between posts. And every time I went to write my thoughts down - my rvm app wasn't working right. Or bundler was out of date. Or the bundler I was running wasn't shimmed correctly and running against a ruby installation that didn't match. And if I reinstall ruby from scratch, how many gems won't build on this laptop? And which rake command publishes? Which rake command creates an empty post? And do I still need to push to github, or does it do that for me?

So I ditched Octopress. This thing? It's shell scripts that I wrote and understand, along with [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/), a tool that follows the Unix philosophy of do one thing and do it well. 

I hope this breaks down one more barrier to writing more. I hope that owning my words (rather than letting someone like Twitter or Facebook or Medium or whomever own them) will make a difference. I hope that eventually I can ditch Github pages so that I can own my words even more, on my own server. But for now, this is great. I have a Markdown editor, I have a couple of shell scripts, and I can publish whatever is on my mind. 

Let's see if it sticks. I haven't written anything here in over two years. Maybe it'll sputter out again.
