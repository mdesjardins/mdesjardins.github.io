<p>I’ve had a interest/passion/fascination with web accessibility (a11y)
ever since I worked at my previous employer, <a
href="https://www.sigient.com">Sigient</a> (note: they might be out of
business now, and that site appears to be down). That particular job was
a consulting company, and I ended up on the staff augmentation side of
the business, which wasn’t particularly awesome, but I’ll save that
story for another time.</p>
<p>I was working with one of the major nationwide internet service
providers in the United States. They too are no longer in business, as
the corporation was recently acquired. One of the things I undertook was
converting some major swaths of their customer portal, an old Backbone
web application, to use React. While I working on that task, the company
had come under pressure to quickly make their customer portal accessible
to users with disabilities. I don’t know where this pressure was coming
from - there were rumors of a lawsuit, but this was hearsay and I have
no idea if there was any truth to it.</p>
<p>At that point in my career, I had very little exposure to web
accessibility. In retrospect, it’s shameful that this is the case, but I
don’t believe it’s uncommon. I’ve been developing websites for well over
15 years, and I had never encountered a situation where anyone made
accessibility a priority. Because of that, I knew almost nothing about
roles or aria attributes, <a href="http://colorsafe.co/">high contrast
color palettes</a>, or the imporatance of using semantic elements and
design to ensure that screen readers would be able to properly interpret
pages. I’m embarrassed to admit that my first exposure to aria
attributes was probably seeing them on <a
href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> documentation, and
thinking to myself “what the heck are those things?”</p>
<p>Since my experience at Sigient, I’ve made a conscious effort to apply
accessibility to my designs whenever I’ve been afforded the opportunity.
Admittedly, my blog needs more contrast and better semantic elements.
Ugh, I’ll add it to my to-do list!</p>
<p>As I’ve transitioned to doing a lot more front-end development,
particularly in <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>, it has
occurred to me that we have an opportunity to reduce the difficulty in
building accessible rich internet applications. Because React (and many
other newer Javascript frameworks) are component-based, component
creators can focus on making their individual components accessible to
disabled users, while application developers can use off-the-shelf
components which have been tested and meet minimum accessibility
guidelines.</p>

<p>This obviously requires buy-in from component developers, but I’m
optimistic that component based UI architecture makes this possible and
achievable.</p>
<h2 id="react-a11y-select">react-a11y-select</h2>
<p>To that end, I’ve started a project on npm to build a web-accessible
select component. The first rule of accessibility is to use native
components whenever possible. However, over the course of my career I’ve
seen many designs requiring select/dropdown components with styled
options containing graphics and other elements. With this project I’m
hoping to make doing so in an accessible way super-simple.</p>
<p>I just started this project recently, and it doesn’t even meet all
the accessibility guidelines yet. It’s not as performant as I’d like and
some of it is pretty hacky. It’s missing some key features that I
desperately want to add. But it’s a start and it’s my very first npm
project, and first component library. I hope to keep plugging away at
it, and eventually introduce a few more components as I get better at
this (I’m thinking I might do Radio buttons next!).</p>
<p>Here’s a link to the project on <a
href="https://github.com/mdesjardins/react-a11y-select">Github</a> and
on <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-a11y-select">npm</a>.
There’s a <a href="http://mikedesjardins.net/react-a11y-select/">live
demo page</a> too.</p>
