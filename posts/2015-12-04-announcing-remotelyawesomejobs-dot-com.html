<article>
<p>Last October I began working on a site that crawls a bunch of
different job boards looking for remote job posts. I wanted to see if I
could go from literally nothing to a fully-functional, useful site in 30
days on my own free time.</p>
<p>I decided on this particular project for an odd reason: lots of other
people were building nearly identical sites. You might think that’d be
discouraging, but I decided that proved it’d be pretty trivial to do,
and that there are definitely people out there who would find it useful.
I have no delusions about this site making me rich, so it’s no big deal
if there are tons of competitors out there.</p>
<p>In the past I’ve used project sites like this to learn new
technology. I hemmed and hawed for a long time about whether I wanted to
use this site as a change to learn Elixir+Phoenix and/or ReactJS. In the
end I decided that the challenge was to build something in 30 days, and
my track record with previous “learning” projects were that, while I’d
learn something, they’d almost never get finished. The extra effort of
teaching myself something new made it harder to finish. The goal for
this project was explicitly <em>not</em> to learn something new in terms
of technology, it was to see if I really could see a project through
from start to finish given the fewest impedements. It turns out I
can!</p>
<p>RemotelyAwesomeJobs is thus unsurprisingly built on Rails 4.2 with
Postgres and Sidekiq in support. There’s minimal Javascript (I decided
that might actually be a virtue in this case - I want something that
works on any device with little fuss). I did decide to host it myself on
DigitalOcean instead of going the stupid-easy Heroku route, mostly
because it’s a lot cheaper to do so once you want more than one
server.</p>
<p>Anyhow, check it out if you’re looking for a remote job. I’m “dog-
fooding” it myself right now, so it should be pretty stable and usable
at this point. ;)</p>
