<p>When I launched Remotely Awesome Jobs in 2015, I was looking for a
job. I was tired of searching through multiple job boards and filtering
on “Remote Only” to find the perfect new workplace.</p>
<p>Since then, hundreds of other job board aggregators have popped up. I
like to think that Remotely Awesome Jobs was one of the better, more
comprehensive boards. But the truth is that I’ve devoted far too little
time to it, and haven’t managed to keep up with the competitors. What
started as a labor of love became a mental drain as I felt guilty for
not doing more to improve the site. I’ve wanted write more blog posts to
drive traffic, I wished to add more job boards to my list of sources,
I’d have liked make it more usable, etc. etc. etc. And those negative
thoughts ended up crowding out happier thoughts in my brain during my
free time.</p>
<p>On top of that, I’ve had to constantly stay on top of hackers.
Remotely Awesome Jobs’ Twitter account (its biggest source of new users)
has been hacked and deleted, and Twitter has been no help in restoring
it. There are people on the internet signing up users who never wanted
the service, and I have no idea why (does anyone know the purpose of
this? I get angry replies from people for this all the time!). I’ve had
to continually install CAPTCHAs and honeypots and other tricks to thwart
spammers. I’ve had fake accounts created on my behalf with my domain
registrar support service. People took advantage of the free posts to
create scammy job posts. When I got rid of the free posts, almost all of
the employers who used to post advertisements evaporated - they didn’t
see the value in posting on Remotely Awesome Jobs when they could just
post elsewhere, and it’s hard to blame them.</p>
<p>So I’m shutting down the site. It’s been fun, I’ve learned a lot, but
it’s no longer worth the effort or time commitment. The pay-per-click
ads barely cover the server and email service costs, there’s little
interest in paid posts, and the constant mental self-flagellation for
neglecting the site isn’t good for me. I want to thank everyone who has
supported me and this site for as long as it’s been up. The site has
served over 70,000 jobs to over 280,000 users. We got 480 upvotes on
Product Hunt. 5000 people signed up for our email list. I’m pretty proud
of all of that. But it’s time to move on.</p>
<p>Thanks again everyone! If you’re looking for an alternative site to
get updates on remote job posts, I recommend browsing the “alternatives”
page on Product Hunt, here:

<p>Happy hunting, - Mike</p>
