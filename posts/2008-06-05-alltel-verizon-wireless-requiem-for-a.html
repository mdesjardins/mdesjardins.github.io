<p>So I guess it’s official: <a
href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/06/05/verizon-alltel-merger-would-form-largest-carrier-in-the-us-by-f/">Verizon
Wireless is acquiring rival Alltel Wireless for $28 billion</a>. I had
another topic in mind for my next post, but I decided to write about
this market consolidation instead.</p>
<p>In a former life, I designed and did programming for billing systems
for “tier three” (i.e., small, regional) wireless carriers. In many
ways, it’s saddening to see what the mobile carrier landscape has become
in the United States. One of the things that made it fun to work in the
industry was the funky, inspired little companies that were created by
scrappy hometown entrepreneurs. It took a certain amount of chutzpah and
ingenuity to take on the behemoth teleco’s, even if it was a small rural
corner of East Podunk, U.S.A.</p>
<p>Lots of people worked for the “Cellular Ones” of the world. I met
some folks who got pretty wealthy by building medium-sized businesses by
taking on the incumbent wireline carrier in their neck of the woods.
These people hailed from small towns like Beckley, West Virginia, or
Fort Morgan, Colorado, or Traverse City, Michigan. A lot of the
employees were self-trained and didn’t have years of experience as
Billing Directors or Network Engineers; sometimes it was so-and-so’s
brother-in-law who was appointed to be the “Switch Tech” because he was
good with electronic stuff.</p>
<p>I believe that these homegrown businesses are good for America. The
people who operate them care about their communities because they see
their neighbors every day. They hire local people to staff their call
centers instead of outsourcing to distant continents. Their leaders do
business with their local friends. These businesses help give their part
of the world its own personality.</p>
<p>At one time, I thought that MVNO’s might fill this void – I had hoped
that they could supplement the market with their own quirky
personalities. But so far, MVNO’s have failed to gain much traction in
the U.S.</p>
<p>I realize that some good things will come from consolidation. Bigger
companies can often roll out better technology more quickly. It’s harder
for, e.g., a small time operation in Decatur, Illinois to roll out 3G
data services, than it is for a Goliath like AT&amp;T or Verizon
Wireless. But I still mourn the loss of the tier-3′s; for me, they
exemplified the American entrepreneurial spirit.</p>
