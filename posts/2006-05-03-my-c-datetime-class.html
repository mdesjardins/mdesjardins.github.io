<p>My C++ Date/Time class is now available on this site under the
“Geeky” tab on the navbar. I was hoping to do so much more with it. I
wanted documentation (maybe with doxygen), I wanted to compile it on a
bunch of different compilers and beef up the makefile, I wanted
automated unit tests. In the end I just realized that I’d never have the
time to “finish” it, so I did what all of the other open source
developers do, and put a half-finished, mostly-useful chunk of code out
there. The main difference is that <u>nobody </u>will care about my date
class. Probably nobody will even read this.</p>
<p>I wrote it because I didn’t like the date class I was using where I
worked, and I really didn’t want to use the one available at Boost.org.
I wanted something stupid simple to use, like Java’s java.util.Date, and
it’s companion, SimpleDateFormatter. Why can’t C++ be more like Java?
There are things that can make C++ more usable which don’t affect the
language at all. The biggest thing is the libraries and the packaging.
You can’t beat importing a package from a jar file. And you can’t beat
having things like HttpClient and Date available in the libraries that
come with the language. I know the latter will never happen… the beauty
of having one company “control” a language is that decisions can be made
about APIs quickly and easily. That will never happen in a
standardization committee.</p>
<p>Oh, well.</p>
