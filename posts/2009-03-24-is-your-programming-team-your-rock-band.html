<p>I’m sure that I’m not the person to make this connection, but it
occurred to me the other day that being on a small team of coders is a
lot like being in a band.  I’ve been in a couple bands that never went
far beyond the garage (I’m allegedly a bass player), so perhaps I’m not
the foremost authority on this topic.  However, I think there are a few
parallels between building, e.g., a small MVC web application, and
writing and performing the next standard verse-chorus-verse rock
anthem.</p>
<p>In particular, I think there are parallels between the specific
members of a prototypical Rock band, and the members of a team who
create MVC applications:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Drummer</strong> – The Anchor.  Provides the foundation for
the music, onto which the other layers are stacked and woven.  In an MVC
app, this is your database guy/gal.  The person modeling your data and
managing the schematic underpinnings of your application is your
drummer.  And if you’re using a weird schema-less database like CouchDB,
then you have yourself a sloppy jazz drummer, which means more work for
the Bassist.</li>
<li><strong>Bass Player</strong> – The Bass Player sets the groove for
the song, and maps the primal beats that the drummer is hammering out
into something melodic for the rest of the band to work with.  The
bassist is also crucial for carrying the beat for the rest of the band
when the drummer is screwing around (see note about jazz drummers,
above).  In our web application, this is the domain layer, where your
ORM, caching, and validation all chill out.  And like the bass player,
this is rarely the sexiest or most glamorous part of the
application.</li>
<li><strong>Guitarist(s) </strong>- This is your business logic
developer.  Some bands choose to break this up into your traditional
Angus/Malcom roles of “rhythm” and “lead” guitar.  Likewise, you may
choose to have separate model and controller layers in your app
(particularly if you’re a three-tier app: the web tier controller is
your Angus and the middle tier model is your Malcom).  Bass players can
sometimes get by as guitarists in a pinch, and vice versa.  Likewise,
you’ll see business logic guys doing domain work and vice versa.  Just
don’t let them try to play their parts on the wrong instrument – you’ve
gotta separate your concerns, dude.  Aside from the lyrics, this is the
part of the song that your listeners are the most likely to hear.</li>
<li><strong>Lead Singer</strong> – This is your AJAXy, CSS laden, poetic
presentation of your band’s message.  It’s what your listeners hear (and
see) first.  And the singer gets all flustered when the rest of the band
screws up (the singer is a real primadonna, very sensitive). Changing
your lead singer will almost certainly alieniate your fans (think
Facebook redesign – the Sammy Hagar of UI decisions).</li>
</ul>
<p>I tend to get carried away with analogies, and this one is no
different – I could keep going (your roadies are your project managers,
your label is the marketing and executives who make all the money) but
I’ll try to show some restraint.  But given this analogy, I find it
interesting that the role I play on software teams is often similar to
the role I play in a band.  I like bass.</p>
