<article>
<p>A while ago, I had the opportunity to contribute to the <a
href="http://wiki.awn-project.org/">Avant Window Navigator</a> open
source project. My participation in the project has waned lately, but
I’ve had a little time to reflect on the time that I spent working on
it. In no particular order, here were some of the things I took away
from the project. Note that this is just based on a single project, and
that my experience might have been quite different had I participated in
other projects:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Learn to detach yourself from from
your code. </span> Once your stuff is checked into a public repository,
anything can happen. Generally, most people will respect what they see
as “your turf,” but that isn’t always the case. People will suggest
improvements, implement them, and share them with the world before you
even get a chance to review them. Overall, it’s a good thing and part of
the ecology of an open-source project. At your typical office-programmer
job, people usually end up becoming specialists in specific areas and
the demarkation of responsibilities are quite clear, sometimes at the
expense of progress. The boundaries are a lot looser in the open source
community.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Interpersonal Relationships are
Weird</span>. When you’re in an office, you know that Fred is a little
odd, and gets touchy when people criticize his font selection, because
your co-worker warns you when you’re at the coffee machine. Anyone who
lives and dies by their e-mail knows that emotions don’t get conveyed
adequately in text, and the same is true with online forums and IRC
channels. Some people lose their inhibitions when they don’t understand
that they’re communicating with other people, and turn into jerks.
Fortunately, there aren’t very many of these people.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">There’s a wide range in
quality.</span> There’s no entrance requirement, so there’s a pretty
wide variety in code quality. There are some incredible, amazing,
talented people out there who are coding for their love of the craft.
There are also people who make some sub-par stuff.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Apprehension about bugs.</span> When
I started, I was really worried about what would happen when I released
software that was buggy. In a commercial environment, there are often
layers of people between the programmer and the end-user, so bug reports
come to you filtered and sanitized. In the open source world, people
will report bugs openly, directly to you, on forums, for all the world
to see. That made me nervous as hell. It turned out to be not so bad.
The users knew that they were using bleeding edge stuff, and they
expected a degree of instability and seemed to accept it quite well.
They were helpful and sympathetic when reporting problems. I think it
cuts both ways; when users report their software defects to someone far
removed from the programmer, they’re less sympathetic and more irate
than if they’re communicating directly with a person who can help them.
Users are people, just like programmers, and they usually realize that
the programmers are doing this for free and are quite polite.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Uptake on Localization was less
enthusiastic than I thought it’d be.</span> My weather applet was among
the first to support multiple languages. Because there were so many
contributers from outside the U.S. working on AWN, I thought people
would jump at the opportunity to translate my applet to their native
language. In the end, there were only three people who volunteered.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">I felt old. </span> Most of the
people contributing to the project were in college or in their
mid-twenties. I’m in my mid-thirties, and after working for 10 hours,
coming home, feeding the kids and getting them ready for the next day,
it’s 8:00 and I don’t feel much like getting out the laptop and coding.
I managed to sneak in a few cycles at work, but I always felt a little
guilty about it. While the other contributers were complaining about
their upcoming finals, I had to deal with the upcoming PTA meeting.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">You can learn a lot.</span> I got
into this project to “scratch an itch.” I was using Linux at work, I
needed a dock, because I’m a Mac guy and I like docks. AWN was a Dock
for Linux, but it was missing a clock. So I learned Python to create
one. Now I know some Python, and I have a clock on my dock. I’m a happy
man.</p>
