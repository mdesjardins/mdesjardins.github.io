<p>I managed to dig up the old blog. It’s a little bit sad how old these
old posts all are. At one point, I thought I wanted to be a programmer’s
programmer. I wanted to write a book. Something like “Hibernate in
Action.” I followed my former colleague, <a
href="https://chrisbrogan.com/">Chris Brogan</a>, an emerging social
media superstar of the RSS-fueled blogosphere. I created posts with lots
of images and encouraged engagement in the comments.</p>
<p>But that’s not what this is about anymore.</p>
<p>I like to write. For me. I just enjoy it. And every time I had
inspiration, I thought about blogging about it. But the problem was that
my blog was in <a href="octopress.org">Octopress</a>. The premise of
Octopress was great, it simplified pushing posts to your github pages
site! And you could even write your posts in good ol’ Markdown. It’d
generate a static site for you!</p>
<p>But I let a lot of time pass between posts. And every time I went to
write my thoughts down - my rvm app wasn’t working right. Or bundler was
out of date. Or the bundler I was running wasn’t shimmed correctly and
running against a ruby installation that didn’t match. And if I
reinstall ruby from scratch, how many gems won’t build on this laptop?
And which rake command publishes? Which rake command creates an empty
post? And do I still need to push to github, or does it do that for
me?</p>
<p>So I ditched Octopress. This thing? It’s shell scripts that I wrote
and understand, along with <a href="https://pandoc.org/">pandoc</a>, a
tool that follows the Unix philosophy of do one thing and do it
well.</p>
<p>I hope this breaks down one more barrier to writing more. I hope that
owning my words (rather than letting someone like Twitter or Facebook or
Medium or whomever own them) will make a difference. I hope that
eventually I can ditch Github pages so that I can own my words even
more, on my own server. But for now, this is great. I have a Markdown
editor, I have a couple of shell scripts, and I can publish whatever is
on my mind. Let’s see if it sticks.</p>
